# Markov_Sentence_Generator
Sentence generator using a markov chain with probabilities garnered from word frequency in a given text. For now I will be using A Study In Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle pulled from Gutenburg.org.

If you happen upon this repo and find any mistakes please point them out to me with sugestions of how to fix them! I'm sure to make a good amount and am trying to learn and improve!
