# Markov_Sentence_Generator
Sentence generator using a markov chain with probabilities generated from word frequency in a given text pulled from Gutenburg.org. For now I will be using A Study In Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

If you happen upon this repo and find any mistakes please point them out to me with sugestions of how to fix them! I'm trying to learn and am sure to make a good amount!
